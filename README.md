## Problem 1

### Running the Solution
To run the solution for the first problem, follow these steps:

1. First, add your test cases to the `input1.txt` file.

#### Format of the File:

The `input1.txt` file should have the following format:

- The first line represents `n`, the number of test cases.
- This is followed by `n` test cases, each on a separate line.

#### Example:
```
4
BBBB
WWBBB
WBBBWWWB
WBWBWBWWB
```

#### Explanation:

- The first line represents the number of test cases, `n = 4`.
- This is followed by 4 test cases: `["BBBB", "WWBBB", "WBBBWWWB", "WBWBWBWWB"]`.

2. Run the following command:
  run the following command:  python problem1.py


## Problem 2

### Running the Solution
To run the solution for the second problem, follow these steps:

1. First, add your test cases to the `input2.txt` file.

#### Format of the File:

The `input2.txt` file should have the following format for each test case:

- The first line represents `n`, the number of test cases.
- The next line represents `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines (i.e., rows of the grid).

#### Example:

```
3
3 5
.X.X.
.X...
.X.X.
3 5
.X...
..X..
...X.
2 2
.X
..
```

#### Explanation:

- The first line represents the number of test cases, `n = 3`, followed by 3 test cases.
- 1st Test Case:
  - `n = 3`, `m = 5`
  - Grid:
    ```
    .X.X.
    .X...
    .X.X.
    ```

- 2nd Test Case:
  - `n = 3`, `m = 5`
  - Grid:
    ```
    .X...
    ..X..
    ...X.
    ```

- 3rd Test Case:
  - `n = 2`, `m = 2`
  - Grid:
    ```
    .X
    ..
    ```

2. Run the following command:
  ```python problem2.py```
