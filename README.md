# Assignment
## Problem 1
To run the first problem solution
First add you testcase in the input1.txt

Format of the file:\
First line represents n: number of test cases  followed by n testcase.\
Example:\
  4\
  BBBB\
  WWBBB\
  WBBBWWWB\
  WBWBWBWWB

Explaination:
First line represents number of test cases , n = 4
Followed by 4 testcases
["BBBB","WWBBB","WBBBWWWB", "WBWBWBWWB"]

run the following command:  python problem1.py

## Problem 2
To run the first problem solution
First add you testcase in the input2.txt
Format of the file:
First line represents n: number of test cases
Next line represents n and m followed by n - lines,i.e. rows of grid
This repeats for n-testcases

Example:
3
3 5
.X.X.
.X...
.X.X.
3 5
.X...
..X..
...X.
2 2
.X
..

Explaination:
First line represents number of test cases , n = 3 followed by 3 testcases
1st testcase:
3 5
.X.X.
.X...
.X.X.
First line represents n and m followed by n-rows of grid
n = 3, m = 5
grid = ['.X.X.', '.X...', '.X.X.']

2nd testcase:
n = 3, m = 5
grid = ['.X...', '..X..', '...X.']

3rd testcase:
n = 2, m =2
grid = ['.X', '..']


run the following command:  python problem2.py
